## Unity Reinforcement Learning Tanks

**Unity Reinforcement Learning Tanks** is a Unity-based 3D game where an AI-controlled tank learns to fight through reinforcement learning. Built with Unity ML-Agents, the project simulates a combat arena where agents train to outmaneuver, aim at, and destroy opponents through trial and reward.

> **Reinforcement Learning applied to a Unity Game** — showcasing intelligent agent behavior in a dynamic combat environment.

### 🧠 AI Features

- 📍 Observations include position and velocity of nearest tanks
- 🔄 Predictive aiming based on movement
- 🏆 Reward system encourages hits, survival, and tactical behavior

### 🎮 Gameplay
- 1 AI tank vs firendly and enemy tanks
